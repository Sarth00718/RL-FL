    "### Game Description\n",
    "Blackjack is a card game played between a player and a dealer. The objective is to get a hand total as close as possible to 21 without exceeding it (busting).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Card Values\n",
    "- Number cards (2–10) are worth their face value.\n",
    "- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.\n",
    "- Ace can be worth either 1 or 11. When it is counted as 11 without busting, it is called a usable ace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Rules\n",
    "- Both player and dealer are dealt two cards: one face up and one face down.\n",
    "- The player sees their own cards and the dealer's face-up card.\n",
    "- The player can:\n",
    "  - **Hit (1)**: Take another card.\n",
    "  - **Stick (0)**: Stop taking cards.\n",
    "- If the player's total exceeds 21, the player busts and loses immediately.\n",
    "- After the player sticks, the dealer reveals the hidden card and draws until the total is at least 17.\n",
    "- If the dealer busts, the player wins.\n",
    "- If neither busts, the hand closer to 21 wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards\n",
    "- Win: +1\n",
    "- Draw: 0\n",
    "- Lose: -1\n",
